# Run the simulation testbenches. The runner takes care of the headless setup
# itself: it starts one shared Xvfb for the whole run and points every
# xschem/ngspice job at it (iic-jku/analog-circuit-design#78), so no plot
# windows pop up and nothing here has to provide a display. $DISPLAY is empty in
# the test container (see run_integration_tests.sh), which is what makes the runner
# set up its own server.
#
# JOBS: run a small pool of testbenches concurrently. This whole test is already
# one job of run_integration_tests.sh's GNU parallel pool (one job per core), so a
# per-core pool in here would oversubscribe the CPU by nproc^2; a pool of 4
# keeps the oversubscription bounded while dropping the wall clock from the sum
# of all testbench runtimes to roughly the longest one.
#
# SPICE_THREADS=1: ngspice threading does not pay off for these testbenches and
# badly hurts the two that dominate the runtime -- techsweep_sg13g2_lv_{n,p}mos
# sweep L x Vg x Vd x Vb and thus issue ~119k separate `run` commands on a
# single transistor each, where per-run OpenMP fork/join overhead is all that
# extra threads add (measured: 23 s with 1 thread vs 164 s with 9). Passed
# explicitly so the test does not depend on the age of the clone;
# iic-jku/analog-circuit-design#79 makes it the runner's default.
