# The image uninstalls PySide6-Addons to save ~340 MB (QtWebEngine, Qt3D, ...).
# The Essentials, Addons and meta-package wheels all ship the same top-level
# PySide6 files (__init__.py, _config.py, _git_pyside_version.py, the .pyi
# stubs), and pip does no cross-package refcounting -- so that uninstall
# happily deletes files the remaining packages still own. Check that every
# file the installed PySide6 distributions claim is actually on disk, which
# catches the whole class of "pip uninstall gutted a sibling wheel" breakage
# rather than just the symptom it produced in chipify/snp2le.
