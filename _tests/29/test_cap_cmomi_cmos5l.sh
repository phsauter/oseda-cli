# Test the cap_cmomi MoM capacitor of ihp-sg13cmos5l in ngspice and VACASK.
#
# cap_cmomi is the PDK's only capacitor and its only own Verilog-A model, so it
# is the one device that exercises the CMOS5L-specific parts of the image:
# the OSDI object built by install_ihp_cmos5l.sh, the PDK .spiceinit picked up
# via SPICE_USERINIT_DIR, and the ng2vclib model conversion for VACASK.
#
# The reference capacitances are the values the KLayout PCell writes into its
# own C= label, so a drift makes layout and simulation disagree.
