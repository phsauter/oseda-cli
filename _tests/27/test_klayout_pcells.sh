# Smoke/regression test of the KLayout PCells of all supported PDKs.
#
# For every PDK (sky130A, gf180mcuD, ihp-sg13g2, ihp-sg13cmos5l) this test
# loads the PDK's KLayout PCell libraries and instantiates every PCell once
# with its default parameters, then flags empty cells (no geometry) and thrown
# errors. The heavy lifting is done by check_pcells.py, which also compares the
# outcome against a pinned per-PDK baseline; this wrapper drives it per PDK and
# aggregates the verdicts.
#
# A few PCells are DIRTY (empty) on purpose in the current PDKs; check_pcells.py
# pins them so the test is green now yet fails on any regression. See README.md.
#
# Only the verdict is printed on the console; the per-PDK results and the full
# KLayout output go into the log. Set PCELL_TEST_VERBOSE=1 to see every PCell.
