# Perform required preparation of IHP CMOS5L PDK for use with VACASK.
# Upstream's sg13cmos5ltovc.py does all of it (requested as
# https://codeberg.org/arpadbuermen/VACASK/issues/94): it converts the ngspice
# models, compiles cap_cmomi.va to OSDI, symlinks in the SG13G2 OSDI objects,
# writes .vacaskrc.toml and patches the xschem symbols and xschemrc.
# Needs VACASK >= b9ca96e, which keeps the conversion of the models CMOS5L
# symlinks from SG13G2 inside the CMOS5L tree and makes cap_cmomi's feed
# default a literal, so it stays overridable (regression test 29).
#
# The converter names the devices it handles in two hardcoded lists, while the
# PDK is installed unpinned and grows devices between VACASK releases, so the
# lists are completed from the PDK before it runs (see the helper for what that
# costs when it is not done -- it broke the whole CMOS5L VACASK capacitor path
# when cap_cmomf arrived).
